# minesweeper-frontend

Frontend react app for Minesweeper game. Used create-react-app project and material UI GridList. Responsiveness is not great but it works. I would rather made whole game logic on frontend to make it more responsive and use API to provide persistance , time tracking , and information about past games.

App is deployed on now.sh since it's faster for react projects

## Usage

Game initializes on refresh:

1. Left click: opens the cell.

2. Right click: flags if cell is hidden. Unflags if cell is flagged.

When mine is clicked opens the board completely. 

## Future work

I focused on backend API over clien because exercise is focus on python language

1. Add more feedback when game is over or won.
2. Add user controls to restart
3. Add game information (hidden squares/flags remaining)
