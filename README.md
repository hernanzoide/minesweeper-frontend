# minesweeper-backend
API test

Backend REST api for Minesweeper game. Based on IBM Flask Python starter project: https://github.com/IBM/python-flask-app. The reason for using this project was I was optimistic about being able to implement more feature and project structure was suitable for having multiple services for game operations, data storage, time tracking and others

## Controllers

Added minesweeper controller with 3 simple operations:

1. initialize: Initializes the board for the player to start working. 
2. open: Takes the cell id as parameter. Opens the cell and updates the whole board according to minesweeper rules
3. flag: Flags or unflags the cell

## Model

Game: Handles game variables. Manages two boards one for the values hidden and other to show to the player
Board: Used to store the values under the hidden cells
PlayerBoard: Used to store the values the player sees. Implements the basic operations for the user.
Square: A cell in the board. Keeps the state accordingly

Sizes for the boards are class attributes so they can be resized before instanciation. Should be used inside a service but there was no time for that.

## Future work

My focus was on having a deliverable according to expected. Since features were optional I prioritized deployment over the implementation of more features.

1. Create service for handling games to allow multiple. Games use owner id in constructor so we could use it to retrieve the game for a specific player from the data storage in the future.
2. Create services for time tracking and user managing
3. Add persistence
